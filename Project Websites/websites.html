                        <p>
                            I created this website in the first semester of Web Design 
                            & Development I, so I didn’t create it in this course, but 
                            I did add some of my beginning JavaScript projects to it. 
                            When I made it, I went with the theme of coffee for my first 
                            project website.

                            <br><br>

                            Since I only added a few of my simple Javascript projects, 
                            I worked with this website for the first few weeks of this 
                            semester before creating a new website to work on my projects. 
                            <br> I copied over the simple projects from this website to the 
                            new one & left the website as is with the few javascript 
                            projects. I thought the projects matched the simplicity of 
                            this website nicely.

                            This website is the one I worked with the most this semester. 
                            It was one I created a few weeks into this course, where I 
                            put my previous projects from the MiniCodes website & where 
                            I built my new projects as they were assigned. This website 
                            was also when I updated my navigation bar to have dropdowns 
                            because I had too many projects already (& coming) to fit on 
                            my original nav bar.

                            <br><br>

                            One of the assignments I was given during this time was to 
                            give one of my projects a big update, where I chose to update 
                            my simple calculator. The update was to turn it into a 
                            Scientific Calculator & give it a new design. Here’s the link 
                            to my reflection on this project update:

                            For the last few weeks of this semester, we were given a final 
                            project to work on & this website is my final project. The 
                            requirements for this project were to have at least 4 pages a 
                            user could go into, with 2 having dynamic interactions, & an 
                            email form that sends an email with the data collected. <br> I 
                            worked on this final project for 3 weeks, making adjustments 
                            as I went due to my health at the time, ending up meeting the 
                            requirements & making two of my favorite projects; the Scientific 
                            Calculator & the Daily To-Do List.
