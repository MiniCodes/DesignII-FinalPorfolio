                <p>
                    Hello! Thank you for checking out my design portfolio!

                    <br><br>

                    This website is one I made from scratch so that I may show what I’ve 
                    been working on this past semester. I have a few different items in 
                    this portfolio & so that you may not get confused, I will explain. 
                    <br> The page for “Project Websites” holds all of the websites I have 
                    created or worked on for this semester, giving a short description 
                    of each website I made or worked on. The rest of the tabs in the 
                    navigation bar shows all of the projects I worked on & made throughout 
                    the semester. <br> I put each project under a tab according to when I 
                    created the project. The most recent projects are part of the Final 
                    Dynamic tab, and the oldest under the Simple JS Projects tab. These 
                    projects are the same ones in my Project Websites; only they’re here 
                    for your convenience!

            <p>
                This semester I learned a lot of information, especially because I 
                learned a new language, JavaScript. Before this semester, I hadn’t 
                learned any other languages except for Python, <br> which didn’t really help 
                me with this course. I struggled with Javascript for a few things, but 
                especially when it came to For Loops because they didn’t work/look the 
                same as For Loops in Python. <br> I eventually figured out how to make simple 
                For Loops with the help of W3Schools or a helpful YouTube video, but I 
                definitely did much better with the different kinds of If Statements. 
                <br> At the beginning of the semester, I also struggled with coding with 
                Javascript in general, but I’ve gotten better after all of the projects 
                this semester. 
                While I did well with design (designing how things look & work) before 
                this semester, I got more chances to explore how to design Javascript 
                projects both visually & their code, Websites, and Files. <br> I also explored 
                how Javascript can influence design or change an entire website’s color 
                theme with a button. Though I’m not great at designing more complicated 
                things with Javascript yet.

                <br><br><br>

                I’d say that a lot of things went well for me this semester, with a few 
                stops along the way due to my health. <br> This semester I did end up learning 
                Javascript to a good point, though I still need to work with it more. I got 
                to work on fun projects, even making my project idea of changing a website’s 
                color theme with a button, and learn how to design these projects. <br> I got 
                most to all of my projects turned in while my health wasn’t great, and when 
                I needed help or explanations, others were there to help. Though if I could 
                have done things differently, I would have finished that Telephone project 
                before the end of the semester, and I probably would have communicated more 
                with my teacher about my health & how much time & energy I lost for my 
                projects because of it. However, I think things turned out great. <br> I passed 
                this class & got to turn in all of my fun projects & my designs before the 
                end of the semester/year!

                        This project was one of my favorites for a few reasons, 
                        one being that I found the challenge after realizing I 
                        couldn’t do my original project plan. <br><br> Though another 
                        reason is the design of this project, I spent a lot of 
                        time with the colors for this project. <br> As you can see 
                        above (or when you click the link to go to the project) 
                        when you cross out a task, it’s given different colors 
                        than a normal or an unfinished task. 
                        <br><br> In general, I’m 
                        happy with how this project works & looks!

                        I loved the challenge & simplicity of this project; 
                        it was difficult to set up in a way where the JavaScript 
                        I used for the original simple calculator worked for 
                        all buttons yet simple to design. In the end, I set up 
                        the code for the more advanced functions separately from 
                        the basic functions of the calculator. I kept the 
                        original code for the basic functions & just built 
                        onto the code for the advanced functions.

                        <br><br>

                        The design was simple. I rounded out the calculator 
                        because I wasn’t fond of the square/rectangle look as 
                        much. <br> It did take longer to get the right colors for 
                        this project as I wanted it to be green, which meant 
                        playing with multiple shades of green that went with 
                        the colors of my website.

                        <br><br>

                        I’m really proud of myself for this project; I like the 
                        functions I added & the design for it as well. It was 
                        fun to create/build!

                        I liked creating this project because when I was learning 
                        to code for the first time with Python, this was one of 
                        the first games I created. <br> I found it fitting to create 
                        another game when I learned Javascript, both games aren’t 
                        the same, but the idea came from when I first built it 
                        in Python. <br> The game is simple, the user makes guesses for 
                        a random number until they get it correct, & the game 
                        counts how many tries it takes the user.

                        <br><br>

                        This project was fun to make & it has a special place in 
                        my heart. I will probably continue this tradition of 
                        making number games when I learn a new language, that is, 
                        if it allows me to.
